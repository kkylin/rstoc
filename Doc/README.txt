Here is the source code associated with the paper "Control
theory and experimental design in diffusion processes" by
Kevin K Lin, Gilse Hooker, and Bruce Rogers.  The paper may
be found at

  http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3739

Example scripts, with the names 'test-*.r', are provided in
the 'Examples' directory.  The test scripts illustrate
typical usage:

- construct optimal control policy run experiments under

- different set-ups and do MLE

- repeat to obtain estimate of MLE variance

Main directory contains the real code.

We do not currently have the time to document the code as
carefully as we'd like, nor is the interface as simple as it
could be.  But we hope the code is reasonably readable, and
provides a useful starting point should you wish to do some
experiments of your own or write your own implementation
from scratch.

WARNING.  Some of this code, particularly the 2D examples,
require > 2 GB of RAM to run.

If you have questions or comments, please contact Kevin K
Lin <klin@math.arizona.edu>.
